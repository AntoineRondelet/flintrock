# Contributing Guide

**flintrock is still under heavy development. Until we make a 0.1 release, most PRs will be rejected.** We are likely already fixing or making that thing you want to open a PR for, and major components are rapidly evolving so your PR is likely to be invalidated by upcoming changes you may not know about.

This guide was heavily inspired by the [Phabricator contributor docs](https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabcontrib/).

## Principles

* Weigh maintenance burden carefully.


## Contributing Thanks

* We humans can be quite simple. A thank you motivates us and gives us energy.


## Contributing Bug Reports

* Provide a [short, self contained, and correct example](http://sscce.org/) of the problem you are seeing.
* Reports will otherwise likely be ignored unless they are really easy to find and fix.


## Contributing Feature Requests

* **Describe your problem first**: What are you trying to do? Explain the root problem clearly. This is more important than describing your proposed solution.

  When we understand your feature request in the context of what you are really trying to do, we can better evaluate any proposed solutions and perhaps even come up with a better solution that you might not see.

  Describing your original problem or use case will also help us avoid the [X-Y Problem](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem), which can waste a lot of everyone's time.

## Contributing Code

Sometimes, you just wanna write some code.

### Obvious bug fixes

Go right ahead.

### New features, non-trivial changes

* Coordinate first.

### No

* gratuitous customization
* new config options
